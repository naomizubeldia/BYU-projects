## Analysis of Correlated Data
  ### Homework 
    * [Food Expenditures](FoodExpenditures.pdf) - This homework is practicing how to deal with the violation of the equal variance assumption, or heteroskedasticity, within a regression model.
    * [Item Demand](Itemdemandhw3.pdf)- This homework goes over how to deal with time series that have temporal correlation, or correlation between data points, using different models like AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, and SARIMA.
    * [Cardiovascular Health](hearthw4.pdf) - This homework is over longitudinal data that has a violation with the independence assumption due to correlation between points, which is accounted for using a covariance matrix.
    * [Irrigated Agriculture](Iffigationhw5.pdf) - This homework practices how to deal with spatial correlation being in a model using a covariance  matrix with a correlation function.
    * [Heat-Related Mortality](heatHW.pdf) -  This homework reviewed how to work with a model that violates independence, normality, and equal variance using a areal correlation tests and spatial basis function.
  ### Projects
    * [Pedagogy](Project 1.pdf) - This was a group project over dealing heteroskedasticity.
    * [PM Exposure](PMProject.pdf) - A group project that deal with longitudinal data.
    * [Home Appraisals](HousingAppraisals.pdf) - This was my final group project that dealt with areal data.

## Data Science Process
  * [Midterm](midtermcode.ipynb) - This midterm was over data cleaning and wrangling to pull out answers for my midterm.
  * The data I used for the midterm is [life expectancy] (life_expectancy_years.csv) and [hapiscore] (hapiscore_whr.csv).

## Nonparametric Statistical Methods
  *[Report 1](naomireport1.pdf) - I cleaned gold data and performed a parametric t-test and the following nonparametric tests: Wilcox-Mann Whitney Test, Permutation Test, and Randomization Test. I was trying to determine the best test to learn what time of year the prices of gold are usually.

  *[Report 2](Report2.pdf) - I used data from the Montgomery police department to see if the police officers were fairly giving out citations to people pulled over. I looked at the factors of seat belt, gender, race, and car color to see which race and gender are more likely to get a ciation based on car color and seat belt being worn. I used a GLM tree to determine what combination was the most likely.
